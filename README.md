# Painter

## About
Painter is a CSS library that builds on extra pre-defined styles to bootstrap.

## Adding to your project
To add Painter to your project, simply download the files in the <code>build</code> folder. Use <code>compiled.css</code> for all added styles, or select singular ones from the <code>uncompiled</code> folder.
